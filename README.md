Python beginners, such as myself, always have a common question on how to improve their Python skills in an easy and interesting way.
I think Checkio is the best answer to this question.

Checkio is a website for Python and JavaScript’s learners that provides a lot of practical use and interesting questions. 
https://checkio.org/

The UI of Checkio’s website is like Games’ UI.
You need to solve more questions so that you can expand your territories.
The more you solve, the  more questions  become difficult.
Unlike other textbooks, questions in Checkio are more practical use.

If you were a Python lover, I highly recommend you give it a try.

Here, I will upload the code I wrote.
My code isn’t the best or the simplest one,
actual engineers who use Python at their jobs can write much better than me,
but I still hope my code can somehow help you.

I broke my code down  for simple understanding .
You can easily  find the answer to the question you are looking for.

If you have any questions or suggestions,
 you are welcome to email me.
